# Tesla Car Price Prediction ðŸš—

An interactive application developed with **Streamlit** that uses a **Machine Learning** model to predict the price of Tesla cars (Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y) based on data collected from various sources through web scraping techniques.

## Project Description

This project aims to provide an intuitive tool that allows users to estimate the price of a Tesla car based on its characteristics.

### Project Workflow:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Data was collected from specialized car sales websites through **web scraping**:
     - [Coches.net](https://www.coches.net)
     - [Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com)
     - [TeslaHunt.com](https://www.teslahunt.com)

2. **Data Processing:**
   - The data was cleaned and processed in a controlled environment.
   - Categorical variables such as model, color, and country were encoded using **LabelEncoder**.
   - Mileage was normalized using a scaler (**MinMaxScaler**).

3. **Model Training:**
   - A **Random Forest** model was used due to its robustness, ability to handle tabular data, and excellent performance with nonlinear relationships.
   - The model was trained using the following features:
     - Car model (Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y).
     - Manufacturing year.
     - Mileage.
     - Color.
     - Country.

4. **Streamlit Implementation:**
   - The application allows users to select the car's features through an intuitive graphical interface.
   - It uses serialized files in **pickle** format to load the trained model and preprocessing objects (scaler and encoders).

## Functionality

### **1. Web Scraping**
The input data was obtained using web scraping scripts located in the `webscrapping` folder. These scripts collect data from the following sites:
- **Coches.net**: Tesla cars for sale.
- **Tesla.com**: Official information about base prices.
- **TeslaHunt.com**: Listings of second-hand Tesla cars.
- **Autoocasion24**: Tesla car prices in different countries.

### **2. Model Training**
The prediction model was trained with combined and preprocessed data in the `train_model.ipynb` file. The features used include:
- **Car model**: Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y.
- **Year**: Manufacturing year of the car.
- **Mileage**: Distance traveled in kilometers.
- **Color**: Car color.
- **Country**: Location of the car.

### **3. Interactive Interface**
The interface allows the user to:
- Select the car model (with images).
- Input features such as year, mileage, color, and country.
- Obtain a price prediction based on the trained model.

The application also displays the model's accuracy (RÂ² Score).
